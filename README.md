REAL FSHN

AI vs ART

was supposed to be the worlds first ai fashion brand (yeah you read that right) 

literally nothing in the market at the time of making 

user types in prompt, prompt creates image (midjourney), image creates shirt (product you can buy instantly) using printify), user buys the product

no infra required, uses printify store to handle the storage, payments etc. 

built frontend with wix (easier integration, also didn't know frontend at the time)

also did a poster campaign in Toronto

got busy so abandoned project, but managed to sign a couple of people up in waitlist ;)
